-   New Desktop Notifications feature. Get notified when someone sends you a message in an unfocused tab.
-   This is the first "Premium" feature that requires a subscription. You can become a "Premium" member for just $2 a month and will have access to all the premium features and will go a long way toward supporting my work on the extension. You also get a 30 day free trial of the Premium membership and can cancel at any time, I wont hold it against you :)
-   Stay tuned for more updates coming soon, if you would like to influence what I work on next then head over to the trello board and leave a comment or a vote on a feature: https://trello.com/b/Mdpd40Tt/chat-for-trello
